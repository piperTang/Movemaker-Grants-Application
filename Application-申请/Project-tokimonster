Project Overview
Tokimonster's product flow is extremely simple. Whenever you spot a trending topic on Twitter or come up with a token idea, just @Tokimonster and tell it your idea. It will then analyze it and help you deploy the token on DEX on Aptos.

Tokimonster's core functionality is to implement an AI-driven token deployment platform with the following features:
1. AI-driven token deployment: The system uses advanced artificial intelligence models to evaluate the nature of user requests and determine whether they align with positive values.
2. Conversational interface: Users interact with the AI through natural language, eliminating the need for complex blockchain knowledge.
3. Value-oriented approach: The system encourages users who propose ideas with social value, innovative significance, or positive impact.
4. Automated deployment: Once the AI determines that a user's request meets certain requirements, the system automatically deploys the corresponding tokens.

Why We Chose to Undertake This Project
1. Currently, the barrier to token deployment for ordinary users in the blockchain space remains too high. Imagine this: operating a form on Pump Fun, filling out all kinds of information and going through a series of steps — it's way more complicated than just typing a few words on Twitter to explain your token idea.
2. Some existing meme platforms engage in attention-seeking behaviors without boundaries, creating meme tokens that lack any positive value. Meme culture has now been purely replaced by attention-grabbing tactics, losing its original spirit. Many of the meme tokens on Pump Fun today are created solely to attract attention, filled with nothing but negativity. Tokimonster wants to bring the real meme culture back.
3. Many meme projects involve significant insider trading practices, making it difficult for users to distinguish legitimate opportunities.
4. By integrating AI with blockchain technology, we believe that this combination represents an important direction in technological development.

9. What problem are you trying to solve, and why is it important?

Problems We Are Trying to Solve:
1. High barriers and complexity of blockchain technology: Currently, creating and acquiring tokens requires specialized technical knowledge, making it difficult for ordinary users to participate.
2. Lack of value-oriented incentive mechanisms: Existing blockchain ecosystems pay less attention to content quality and social value, focusing more on speculative behavior.
3. Disconnect between AI and blockchain technology: Although both technologies are developing rapidly, their collaborative applications remain limited.
4. Fragmented user experience: Users must navigate through complex technical environments rather than focusing on creativity and value creation.

The Importance of Solving These Problems:
1. Democratizing blockchain technology: By lowering participation barriers, we can democratize blockchain technology. When more people can participate and benefit, the entire ecosystem becomes healthier and more diverse. Technology should not only serve a select elite but should allow everyone to access and create value equally.
2. Fostering a positive community culture: In the cryptocurrency world, speculative behavior often dominates. By rewarding users who propose ideas with social value, innovative significance, or positive impact, we can cultivate a healthier and more constructive community culture.
3. Demonstrating the potential of technology integration: AI and blockchain represent two of today's most cutting-edge technologies, and their combination will generate enormous innovative potential.
4. Reshaping the relationship between humans and technology: We believe technology should serve human needs, not the other way around. Through natural language interfaces and conversational experiences, we redefine how people interact with blockchain technology, making it more intuitive, friendly, and aligned with natural human communication.

10. What is your proposed solution?
Our Solution:
1. We've chosen to integrate Eliza with a Twitter client, allowing users to participate in Tokimonster simply by chatting with our bot.
2. Pre-configured prompts evaluate user conversations to ensure that the tokens they publish have positive value.
3. We utilize Eliza's built-in actions to interact with the Aptos.
4. The user experience is excellent - users can publish tokens just by conversing with the bot.
5. And our bot will trigger the smart contract on Aptos to deploy a single-sided liquidity pool on DEX which is the only UniV3 Dex on Aptos.


11. Any competitions? (Does your project have direct competition or similar project on the market within or without aptos ecosystem?)
Pump.fun, Four.meme, they have similar purpose with us but we have advantages compared to them. The details seen in Q8

12. Why Aptos？
Technical Advantages
1. Move Programming Language: The Move language used by Aptos is designed specifically for blockchain asset security, providing formal verification and a resource-oriented programming model.
2. High Throughput and Low Latency: Aptos's parallel execution engine can handle high-concurrency transactions, ensuring that our system maintains a smooth user experience even as the user base grows.
3. Modular Architecture: Aptos's modular design allows us to extend functionality as needed, which perfectly suits our development model of continuously iterating and improving AI evaluation mechanisms.
Ecosystem Advantages
1. Active Developer Community: Aptos has a rapidly growing developer ecosystem, providing us with rich technical support and collaboration possibilities.
2. Environment Suitable for Innovative Projects: As an emerging Layer 1 blockchain, Aptos especially welcomes and supports innovative projects, which aligns perfectly with our experimental integration of AI and blockchain.
3. User-Friendly Wallet Solutions: The Aptos ecosystem offers a variety of user-friendly wallet solutions, lowering the entry barrier for new users, which is highly consistent with our goal of reducing blockchain participation difficulty.
Strategic Considerations
1. Differentiated Positioning: There’s a gap in the market, and the Aptos ecosystem needs ways to attract users and drive transactions. A token launcher like this is the perfect way to bring that kind of attention.
2. Cost Effectiveness: Compared to mainstream public chains like Ethereum, Aptos's transaction fees are more reasonable, making our token deployment model more sustainable, especially for frequent token deployment operations.
3. Financial Support: Aptos is backed by strong venture capital support, enhancing its stability as a long-term technology partner.
4. Vision Alignment: Aptos's mission is to create a more secure, scalable blockchain network that brings Web3 technology to billions of users, which highly aligns with Tokimonster's vision of lowering the barriers to blockchain participation.
